## 1 Introduction

Distributed finance (or open finance) has evolved to be one of the key drivers of applications on
the TRON network. The core principle of DeFi is to pioneer a censorship-free financial service
ecosystem that is immune to centralized authority and accessible to all. Within the ecosystem,
users are their own asset custodians, and are granted full asset control and ownership. They
can freely access any decentralized market available.

## 2 JustLend Protocol

JustLend is a TRON-powered money market protocol aimed at establishing fund pools whose
interest rates are determined by an algorithm based on the supply and demand of TRON
assets. There are two roles within the protocol, namely suppliers and borrowers. Both of them
interact directly with the protocol to earn or pay a floating interest rate.

On JustLend, each money market corresponds to a unique TRON asset such as TRX, TRC20
stablecoin (e.g. USDT) or other TRC20-based tokens, and entails an open and transparent
ledger that records all transactions and historical interest rates.

## 3 Architecture of JustLend Protocol

JustLend money market is essentially a distributed ledger that allows users to supply or borrow
assets as interest accrues.

## 4 Smart Contract of Money Market

Money markets in the JustLend protocol are built on the basis of smart contracts for money
markets. Users can interact with the JustLend protocol via smart contracts. Here are some key
functions of the smart contracts of money markets on JustLend: Mint、Withdraw、Borrow、Repay、Liquidate.
